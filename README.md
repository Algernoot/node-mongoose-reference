# Referencing in MongoDB with Mongoose and Node.js

A purely backend server that illustrates how to define mongoose Schema/Model with referencing to represent relationships between MongoDB collections.


## Requirements
* [NodeJS & npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
* [MongoDB Community Edition](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) (Must be running in the background)
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - To be able to test the endpoints
* Any text editor for JavaScript, HTML & CSS (VSCode, Atom, SublimeText, etc.)

## Local Setup
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/unisse-courses/node-mongoose-reference.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd node-mongoose-reference`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
  * I've already installed mongoose so it's in the `package.json` file already.
4. Run the server: `node index.js`
  * It should simply be listening on port 9090. There's nothing to open in the browser for this sample.
